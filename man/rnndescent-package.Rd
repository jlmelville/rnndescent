\title{rnndescent: Nearest Neighbor Descent Method for Approximate Nearest Neighbors}
\description{
The Nearest Neighbor Descent method for finding approximate nearest neighbors by Dong and co-workers (2010) \doi{10.1145/1963405.1963487}. Based on the 'Python' package 'PyNNDescent' \url{https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent}.
}
\details{
The rnndescent package provides functions to create approximate nearest
neighbors using the Nearest Neighbor Descent (Dong and co-workers, 2010) and
Random Partition Tree (Dasgupta and Freund, 2008) methods. In comparison to
other packages, it offers more metrics and can be used with sparse matrices.
For querying new data, it uses graph diversification methods (Harwood and
Drummond, 2016) and back-tracking (Iwasakai and Miyazaki, 2018) to improve
the search performance. The package also provides functions to diagnose
hubness in nearest neighbor results (Radovanovic and co-workers, 2010).

This library is based heavily on the 'PyNNDescent' Python library.

General resources:
\itemize{
\item Website for the 'rnndescent' package: \url{https://github.com/jlmelville/rnndescent}
\item Documentation for the 'rnndescent' package: \url{https://jlmelville.github.io/rnndescent/}
\item Website of the 'PyNNDescent' package: \url{https://github.com/lmcinnes/pynndescent}
}

The following functions provide the main interface to the package, with
useful defaults:
\itemize{
\item Find the approximate nearest neighbors: \code{\link[=rnnd_knn]{rnnd_knn()}}
\item Create a search index and query new neighbors: \code{\link[=rnnd_build]{rnnd_build()}}.
\item Query new neighbors (or refine an existing knn graph): \code{\link[=rnnd_query]{rnnd_query()}}.
}

Some diagnostic and helper functions to help explore the the structure of the
graphs and how well the approximation is working:
\itemize{
\item Find exact nearest neighbors: \code{\link[=brute_force_knn]{brute_force_knn()}}, \code{\link[=brute_force_knn_query]{brute_force_knn_query()}}.
\item Merging graphs: \code{\link[=merge_knn]{merge_knn()}}.
\item Hubness: \code{\link[=k_occur]{k_occur()}}.
\item Overlap/accuracy of two neighbor graphs: \code{\link[=neighbor_overlap]{neighbor_overlap()}}.
}

Some lower-level functions are also available if you want more control than
the \verb{rnnd_*} functions provide:
\itemize{
\item Find approximate nearest neighbors: \code{\link[=rpf_knn]{rpf_knn()}}, \code{\link[=nnd_knn]{nnd_knn()}}.
\item Generating random neighbors: \code{\link[=random_knn]{random_knn()}}, \code{\link[=random_knn_query]{random_knn_query()}}.
\item Building an index: \code{\link[=rpf_build]{rpf_build()}}, \code{\link[=rpf_filter]{rpf_filter()}}.
\item Querying an index for new data: \code{\link[=rpf_knn_query]{rpf_knn_query()}}, \code{\link[=prepare_search_graph]{prepare_search_graph()}},
\code{\link[=graph_knn_query]{graph_knn_query()}}.
}
