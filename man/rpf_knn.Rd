\title{Find Nearest Neighbors and Distances Using A Random Projection Forest}
\usage{
rpf_knn(
  data,
  k,
  metric = "euclidean",
  use_alt_metric = TRUE,
  n_trees = NULL,
  leaf_size = NULL,
  max_tree_depth = 200,
  include_self = TRUE,
  ret_forest = FALSE,

  verbose = FALSE,
  obs = "R"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Matrix of \code{n} items to generate neighbors for, with observations
in the rows and features in the columns. Optionally, input can be passed
with observations in the columns, by setting \code{obs = "C"}, which should be
more efficient. Possible formats are \code{\link[base:data.frame]{base::data.frame()}}, \code{\link[base:matrix]{base::matrix()}}
or \code{\link[Matrix:sparseMatrix]{Matrix::sparseMatrix()}}. Sparse matrices should be in \code{dgCMatrix}
format.}

\item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors to return. Optional if \code{init} is
specified.}

\item{metric}{Type of distance calculation to use. One of:
\itemize{
\item \code{"braycurtis"}
\item \code{"canberra"}
\item \code{"chebyshev"}
\item \code{"correlation"} (1 minus the Pearson correlation).
\item \code{"cosine"}.
\item \code{"dice"}
\item \code{"euclidean"}.
\item \code{"hamming"}.
\item \code{"hellinger"}
\item \code{"jaccard"}
\item \code{"jensenshannon"}
\item \code{"kulsinski"}
\item \code{"sqeuclidean"} (squared Euclidean)
\item \code{"manhattan"}
\item \code{"rogerstanimoto"}
\item \code{"russellrao"}
\item \code{"sokalmichener"}
\item \code{"sokalsneath"}
\item \code{"spearmanr"} (1 minus the Spearman rank correlation; not available for
sparse data).
\item \code{"symmetrickl"} (symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence)
\item \code{"yule"}
}

For non-sparse data, the following variants are available with
preprocessing: this trades memory for a potential speed up during the
distance calculation. Some minor numerical differences should be expected
compared to the non-preprocessed versions:
\itemize{
\item \code{"cosine-preprocess"}: \code{cosine} with preprocessing.
\item \code{"correlation-preprocess"}: \code{correlation} with preprocessing.
}

For non-sparse binary data (numeric or integer matrix with 0s
and 1s only) the following metric variants are available which should be
substantially faster than the non-binary variants:
\itemize{
\item \code{"bdice"}
\item \code{"bhamming"}
\item \code{"bjaccard"}
\item \code{"bkulsinski"}
\item \code{"bmatching"}
\item \code{"brogerstanimoto"}
\item \code{"brussellrao"}
\item \code{"bsokalmichener"}
\item \code{"bsokalsneath"}
\item \code{"byule"}
}

Note that if \code{margin = "explicit"}, the metric is only used to determine
whether an "angular" or "Euclidean" distance is used to measure the
distance between split points in the tree.}

\item{use_alt_metric}{If \code{TRUE}, use faster metrics that maintain the
ordering of distances internally (e.g. squared Euclidean distances if using
\code{metric = "euclidean"}), then apply a correction at the end. Probably
the only reason to set this to \code{FALSE} is if you suspect that some
sort of numeric issue is occurring with your data in the alternative code
path.}

\item{n_trees}{The number of trees to use in the RP forest. A larger number
will give more accurate results at the cost of a longer computation time.
The default of \code{NULL} means that the number is chosen based on the number
of observations in \code{data}.}

\item{leaf_size}{The maximum number of items that can appear in a leaf. The
default of \code{NULL} means that the number of leaves is chosen based on the
number of requested neighbors \code{k}.}

\item{include_self}{If \code{TRUE} (the default) then an item is considered to
be a neighbor of itself. Hence the first nearest neighbor in the results
will be the item itself. This is a convention that many nearest neighbor
methods and software adopt, so if you want to use the resulting knn graph
from this function in downstream applications or compare with other
methods, you should probably keep this set to \code{TRUE}. However, if you are
planning on using the result of this as initialization to another nearest
neighbor method (e.g. \code{\link[=nnd_knn]{nnd_knn()}}), then set this to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{ret_forest}{If \code{TRUE} also return a search forest which can be used
for future querying (via \code{\link[=rpf_knn_query]{rpf_knn_query()}}) and filtering
(via \code{\link[=rpf_filter]{rpf_filter()}}). By default this is \code{FALSE}. Setting this to \code{TRUE}
will change the output list to be nested (see the \code{Value} section below).}

\item{margin}{A character string specifying the method used to  assign points
to one side of the hyperplane or the other. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"explicit"} categorizes all distance metrics as either Euclidean or
Angular (Euclidean after normalization), explicitly calculates a hyperplane
and offset, and then calculates the margin based on the dot product with
the hyperplane.
\item \code{"implicit"} calculates the distance from a point to each of the
points defining the normal vector. The margin is calculated by comparing the
two distances: the point is assigned to the side of the hyperplane that
the normal vector point with the closest distance belongs to.
\item \code{"auto"} (the default) picks the margin method depending on whether a
binary-specific \code{metric} such as \code{"bhammming"} is chosen, in which case
\code{"implicit"} is used, and \code{"explicit"} otherwise: binary-specific metrics
involve storing the data in a way that isn't very efficient for the
\code{"explicit"} method and the binary-specific metric is usually a lot faster
than the generic equivalent such that the cost of two distance calculations
for the margin method is still faster.
}}

\item{n_threads}{Number of threads to use.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, log information to the console.}

\item{obs}{set to \code{"C"} to indicate that the input \code{data} orientation stores
each observation as a column. The default \code{"R"} means that observations are
stored in each row. Storing the data by row is usually more convenient, but
internally your data will be converted to column storage. Passing it
already column-oriented will save some memory and (a small amount of) CPU
usage.}
}
\value{
the approximate nearest neighbor graph as a list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{idx} an n by k matrix containing the nearest neighbor indices.
\item \code{dist} an n by k matrix containing the nearest neighbor distances.
\item \code{forest} (if \code{ret_forest = TRUE}) the RP forest that generated the
neighbor graph, which can be used to query new data.
}

\code{k} neighbors per observation are not guaranteed to be found. Missing data
is represented with an index of \code{0} and a distance of \code{NA}.

\description{
Find approximate nearest neighbors using a "forest" of Random Projection
Trees (Dasgupta and Freund, 2008).
}
\examples{
# Find 4 (approximate) nearest neighbors using Euclidean distance
# If you pass a data frame, non-numeric columns are removed
iris_nn <- rpf_knn(iris, k = 4, metric = "euclidean", leaf_size = 3)

# If you want to initialize another method (e.g. nearest neighbor descent)
# with the result of the RP forest, then it's more efficient to skip
# evaluating whether an item is a neighbor of itself by setting
# `include_self = FALSE`:
iris_rp <- rpf_knn(iris, k = 4, n_trees = 3, include_self = FALSE)
# Use it with e.g. `nnd_knn` -- this should be better than a random start
iris_nnd <- nnd_knn(iris, k = 4, init = iris_rp)
# but note you can also run nnd_knn(iris, k = 4, init = "tree") to initialize
# from an RP forest directly

# for future querying you may want to also return the RP forest:
iris_rpf <- rpf_knn(iris, k = 4, n_trees = 3, include_self = FALSE,
                    ret_forest = TRUE)
# forest and nn data can be used to create a smaller forest for querying
# filtered_forest <- rpf_filter(iris_rpf)
